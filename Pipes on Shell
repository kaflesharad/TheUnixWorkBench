Skilled use of Pipes (|) on shell, is the most powerful tool. 
Basic Syntax: 
  [program that produces output] | [new command]
  
It is like fitting an actul pipe between the end of one program and connecting it to the top of another program . 

eg. cat file.txt | head -n 5 
    This command is same as head -n 5 file.txt. It is given here for the illustration of pipe (|) . 

eg. grep "[aeiou]$" states.txt | wc -l
    This command gives the number of states ending with vowel letter as output in the console. 
 
 Pipes can be used multiple times as per the condition as ; 
 
 ls -al | grep "Feb" | less 
 
 
 In Summary; The pipe (|) takes the output of the program on its left side and directs the output to be the input 
 for the program on its right side. 
 
 EXERCISE : 
 a) grep "New" states.txt | wc -l
 
 b) sort ~/.bash_history | uniq | wc -l
