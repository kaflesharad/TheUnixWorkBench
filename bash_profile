bash_profile is a list of UNIX command that runs everytime we open the terminal usually with different commands on every line. 

One of the most common command used in ~/.bash_profile is "alias" command. 

alias command : used to create shortcut command for long commands. 

eg. alias docs = 'cd ~/Documents' 
    Now, we can type docs instead of cd ~/Documents
    
eg. alias edbp = 'nano ~/.bash_profile'
    Now, we can type edbp to open text editor for bash_profile file
    
.bash_profile is a text file that runs everytime we start a shell and it is the best place to assign alias.
